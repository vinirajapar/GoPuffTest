Hello everyone and thanks for reviewing my work.
I focused on add to cart functionality and automated few test cases I came up with.
This framework is maven-cucumber-selenium framework, I wrote my code with Java.
You can run all test case by running runner class.


Below are the tests I didn't automate:
•	Buy items include alcohol with invalid state
•	Buy item below minimal amount
•	Buy multiple items and delete until below minimal amount
•	Buy items include alcohol with invalid state, delete alcohol and purchase
•	Buy multipul items and delete from my bag page
•	Add item to carts with plus button, total mark on “my bag” should be same
•	Add/delete item by item page
•	Add item to carts with plus button, remove from item page

Potential Defect Steps:
1.	User is on https://gopuff.com/go
2.	Click on “Enter delivery address” input box
3.	Click on current location while browser setting is block location
4.	Input box is not interactable

Thank you for your time!
